# Bubble Sort Algorithm in C#

Bubble Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order. This repository contains a straightforward implementation of Bubble Sort and an optimized version that starts from the swapped index and reverses the loop for better performance.

This repository contains two implementations of the Bubble Sort algorithm in C#:

1. Original Bubble Sort: A basic implementation of the Bubble Sort algorithm.
2. Optimized Bubble Sort: An enhanced version that starts from the swapped index and reverses the loop direction for better performance.

## Performance

The optimized version of Bubble Sort improves performance when dealing with partially sorted data. However, for large datasets or more efficient sorting tasks, consider other sorting algorithms.
